# Mid-termReview
Labs to help review for the midterm

#Lab #1

Write a file that contains the following content:
```
Bob;200;20.0
Carl;100;12.0
Denise;92;10.0
```
Name it people.ssv (semi-colon separated values).

Write a program to display the average of the 3rd values and display the name of the person with the highest 2nd value.

This file only has 3 entries, but it could have any number of rows with the same format

#Lab #2

Import the project from https://github.com/CIS232-SP2016/PolymorphismExample/

Modify the MainApplication class to eat a random item from the items array instead of eating all items in order.

Design a new class that implements Food. You have some creative freedom here. Add at least one of your new Food to the items array in the MainApplication class.

#Lab #3

File Encryption Filter Write a program that inputs a String message from the user and then asks the user for a key between 1 and 100. Your program should encrypt the message by adding the key to each character value into a new encoded String. Create a binary file that stores the key and the encoded String called "secret.msg".

Write a second program that displays the contents of "secret.msg" by reading the key value and the encoded String value. Then subtract the key from each character to get the original message.

#Lab #4

Write a program that asks the user for the year they were born. If the user enters a non-integer, display a message and ask again (Input validation loop).

Display the user's approximate age by subtracting from 2016.
